# Project Dependencies

- The dependencies are selected to avoid introducing any requirements that are not generally accepted and included on systems by default.
- The required versions of software are provided with macOS Monteray (12.5) and above, or any Debian-based Linux distribution.
- The versions of Bash and GNU Make are frozen on macOS due to software licenses, so we must maintain compatibility with Bash 4 and GNU Make 3
- Future iterations may replace the dependencies on Bash and Make with other software.
- There are no direct dependencies on Docker 
- There are no direct dependencies on the AWS CLI
